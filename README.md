## ✔️ Tools Used

| Category | Tools/Libraries | Purpose |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Data Analysis** | Python, Pandas, NumPy | Data cleaning, manipulation, and statistical aggregation. |
| **Visualization** | Matplotlib, Seaborn | Creating descriptive charts and graphs. |


## 📊 Key Insights and Findings

The analysis was performed on user data, revealing the following key statistics and user segmentation:

### ✨Performance Averages:
* **Average Daily Steps:** **7,638** steps.
* **Average Daily Calorie Burn:** **2,304** calories.
* **Average Active Minutes:** **228** minutes (3.8 hours).

### ✨ User Distribution by Step Count:
| Activity Level | Daily Steps | Percentage of Users | Insight |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Moderately Active (Core)** | 5,000 – 10,000 | **38.7%** | The largest group. Focus on maintaining habits. |

### ✨ Behavioral Findings

Sleep quality, stress levels, and weekly activity analysis revealed critical behavioral patterns:

**High Sleep Quality:🌙** 

92% of users report high sleep quality 
(Sleep efficiency = Total sleep minutes / Total time spent in bed).

**Need for Stress Management:😌** 

85% of users experience moderate stress, and 14.4% show a tendency toward high stress.

**Activity Consistency:🏃‍♂️** 

51.7% of users maintain a regular routine, being active five or more days a week. However, 11.1% remain inactive throughout the week, highlighting a consistently low-engagement segment.

Weekend Slowdown: Activity is not consistent throughout the week.
